# WealthHealth HRnet Application

![Screenshot of HrNet EmployeeList](./src/assets/screenshots/HrnetScreenshot.png)

## About

WealthHealth is a company utilizing an internal web application called **HRnet**, which manages employee records. The application, originally developed using jQuery, has recently been upgraded and rebuilt using React to enhance performance, reduce bugs, and address internal complaints.
This project was undertaken as part of an OpenClassrooms training program.

### Modernization with React

The redevelopment of the HRnet application into React has brought significant improvements in user experience and code maintainability. This modernization helps WealthHealth stay current with modern technologies and improves the efficiency of employee management.

## Modal-Craft Library

A key part of this overhaul was the integration of my custom library [`modal-craft`](https://github.com/ElvisGalvez/Modal-craft). `Modal-Craft` is a React modal component library that offers flexibility and customization.

### Features of Modal-Craft

-   **Customizable**: Adapt the appearance and behavior of modals to meet the specific needs of the HRnet application.
-   **React Friendly**: Designed to integrate seamlessly into modern React applications.
-   **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive interface for integrating and using modals in applications.

## Getting Started

To use the HRnet application or integrate `Modal-Craft` into your project:

1.  Clone the repository:
   
 `git clone https://github.com/ElvisGalvez/hr-net.git` 
    
2.  Install dependencies:
    
     `npm install` 
    
3.  Start the application:
    
    `npm start` 
    

To use `Modal-Craft` in your own React project, install the library via npm:

`npm install modal-craft`


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
